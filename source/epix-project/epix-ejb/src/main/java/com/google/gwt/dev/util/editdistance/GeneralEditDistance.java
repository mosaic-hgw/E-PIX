/**
 * An engine definition for computing string edit distances, and
 * implementation generators.
 *
 * Generally, edit distance is the minimum number of edit operations required
 * to transform one string into another. Being a minimum transform, it
 * forms a metric space (one that is non-negative, symmetric, and obeys
 * triangle inequality).
 *
 * The most common form is Levenshtein distance, where the set of operations
 * consists of:
 * deleting one character;
 * inserting one character; or,
 * substituting one character for another,
 * each having a "cost" of 1.
 *
 * Another common form is Damerau-Levenshtein distance, which adds
 * transpose two adjacent characters
 * to the set of operations. Note that many implementations of
 * Damerau distance do not account for insertion after transposition;
 * this "restricted" Damerau distance does not obey triangle inequality,
 * but is substantially easier to compute than the unrestricted metric.
 *
 * Another variation is to apply differential costs for the various
 * operations. For example, substitutions could be weighted by
 * character type (e.g., vowel<=>vowel being a cheaper edit than
 * vowel<=>consonant).
 *
 * This class defines an engine for computing edit distance from
 * a fixed ("pattern") string to other ("target") strings. The pattern
 * is fixed at instantiation time; this allows an implementation to
 * perform precomputations to make individual target computations faster.
 *
 * To allow further performance optimization, the GeneralEditDistance
 * contract does not require thread-safety. A <tt>duplicate</tt> method is
 * defined to allow additional equivalent instances to be created
 * for separate threads; it is essentially a type-knowledgeable <tt>clone</tt>.

	 * it is typed (to GeneralEditDistance); and, it must not throw
	 * an exception.
